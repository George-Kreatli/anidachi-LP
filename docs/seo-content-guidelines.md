# AniDachi Programmatic SEO — Content Engine Guidelines

This document is the single source of truth for creating new SEO pages on [anidachi.app](https://anidachi.app). Follow it so every page matches the quality of existing pillars (`/watch-anime-together`, `/watch-crunchyroll-together`), guides under `/guides/`, and comparisons under `/compare/`.

## Context

AniDachi is a Chrome extension for creating **watchrooms**, syncing **Crunchyroll** playback, and discussing episodes **asynchronously**—the main differentiator is **async co-watching** (no shared schedule required).

## Canonical anime URL (Template A)

**Do not** use a nested path like `/anime/.../watch-with-friends`. Production uses a **flat** URL:

- **Pattern:** `/watch/{anime-base-slug}-with-friends`
- **Example:** `/watch/attack-on-titan-with-friends`
- **Implementation:** `app/watch/[slug]/page.tsx` — the dynamic `slug` is the full segment (e.g. `attack-on-titan-with-friends`); code strips `-with-friends` to resolve `lib/anime-data.ts`.

**Rationale:** Shorter paths, stable indexed URLs (49+ pages), and avoiding unnecessary 301 chains and crawl budget cost. The phrase `watch-with-friends` as a **suffix** on the slug is enough for relevance; it does not need to be a separate path segment.

## Page template catalog

Identify **one** template per page. **Do not mix** templates.

### Template A — Anime title pages

| | |
|---|---|
| **URL** | `/watch/{base-slug}-with-friends` |
| **Primary keyword** | `watch [Anime Title] with friends` |
| **Secondary** | `[Anime] watch party`, `[Anime] watchroom`, `[Anime] sync Crunchyroll` |
| **Word count** | 450–650 |
| **Schema** | `FAQPage` + `BreadcrumbList` + `Article` |

**Sections (order):**

1. **H1:** `Watch [Anime Title] with Friends — AniDachi Watchrooms` (or equivalent on-brand)
2. **Lede** (60–80 words, lead with `<strong>`): Why this anime is better shared; reference a **concrete** story moment (finale, twist, cliffhanger)—not generic copy. Synopsis context can be informed by Jikan `GET /v4/anime/{id}` (do not copy-paste MAL/Crunchyroll text verbatim for the lede).
3. **Step-by-step setup** (5 numbered steps): Standard AniDachi flow; inject `[Anime Title]` in steps 2 and 3.
4. **Why [Anime] is perfect for async watching** (150–200 words): Episode length, cadence, spoiler/discussion density. Prefer Jikan for `episodes`, `airing`.
5. **Discussion tips** (3–5 bullets): Evergreen but fan-specific hooks.
6. **CTA** → `/#pricing`
7. **Related anime** (3 internal links) → `/watch/{slug}-with-friends` (from Jikan recommendations where possible, matched to your seed list).
8. **FAQ** (exactly 3) + `FAQPage` schema:
   - Does [Anime] have a watch party feature on Crunchyroll?
   - Can I watch [Anime] with friends asynchronously?
   - Do all my friends need Crunchyroll to watch [Anime] together?

5. FAQ (3)

## Global rules

### One primary keyword per page

Check existing routes and Search Console; avoid cannibalization.

Place the primary keyword in: `<title>`, `<h1>`, first ~100 words, at least one `<h2>`, meta description.

- **Title:** `"[Primary Keyword] — AniDachi"` (≤60 characters)
- **Description:** one sentence answer + CTA (≤155 characters)

### Internal linking (minimum 3 per new page)

- One to `/` or `/#pricing`
- One to a pillar: `/watch-anime-together` or `/watch-crunchyroll-together`
- One to a related live page
- Add every new guide/listicle route to `lib/guide-links.ts` so hub pages can pick it up automatically.

When you add a Template A page, update the **pillar** (e.g. “Popular anime”) so the graph stays bidirectional.

### Schema

Use JSON-LD via the shared components in `components/json-ld.tsx`. Always include **BreadcrumbList**; add **FAQPage** when an FAQ block exists; **HowTo** on Template C; **ItemList** on Template D; **Article** on article-style pages as implemented.

### Content quality

- No filler openers (“In today’s world…”, “Anime fans know…”).
- Reading level: grade 8–10; paragraphs ≤3 sentences; bullets for steps and comparisons.
- **Anime facts** (episodes, score, airing) should come from **Jikan** when publishing or refreshing pages—not invented.
- At least one **anime-specific** detail per Template A page (arc, episode beat, character moment).
- CTA: visible early on long pages (Template D) **and** at the end.

### URL and file naming

- Lowercase, hyphens, no trailing slash.
- Drop stop words in slugs unless they are part of the query.
- App Router examples: `app/watch/[slug]/page.tsx`, `app/guides/.../page.tsx`, `app/compare/.../page.tsx`.

## Jikan API (`lib/jikan.ts`)

The repo includes typed helpers in `lib/jikan.ts` and, for programmatic watch pages, `lib/jikan-for-watch-page.ts` (React `cache` for one Jikan request per page) plus `lib/anime-mal-ids.ts` (slug → MAL id). Server-side fetch uses `next: { revalidate: 86400 }` (24h) for caching. If Jikan is unavailable, pages fall back to the copy in `anime-data.ts` and the static `related` list.

Common endpoints:

- `GET /v4/anime?order_by=members&sort=desc&limit=25`
- `GET /v4/anime/{id}`
- `GET /v4/anime/{id}/recommendations`
- `GET /v4/anime/{id}/episodes`

Respect Jikan’s rate limit (~3 rps); for bulk builds, serialize requests or pre-seed `lib/anime-data.ts` and enrich later.

---

## `lib/anime-data.ts` (build-time slugs)

Used for `generateStaticParams` and local copy. Each entry: `slug`, `title`, unique written synopsis, `episodes` string, `genres` (3), `related` (3 slugs to existing entries). Add titles with **≥~100k MAL members** for Template A at scale.

---

## Sitemap (`app/sitemap.ts`)

- Template A URLs are generated from the anime list (`/watch/{slug}-with-friends`).
- New static pages must be added to the static routes list.
- Priorities: pillar 0.9; compare + guide 0.8; listicle 0.7; anime title 0.6; glossary 0.5 (adjust to match `sitemap.ts` when editing).

---

## `dateModified` protocol

- Set `datePublished` once at launch.
- Bump `dateModified` on every **meaningful** content edit (use `YYYY-MM-DD` in `SeoPageLayout`).
- Do not backdate to manipulate freshness.

---

## Table of contents (on-page SEO)

Long SEO pages should pass a `headings` array into `SeoPageLayout` so users (and search features) can jump to sections. Each linked section needs a stable **`id` on the corresponding `<h2>`** (or `h3`) that matches the TOC.

**Rationale:** In-page anchor navigation supports “Jump to” style behavior in SERPs when headings are clear and first-party anchor links are consistent.

---

## Interactive TOC component

Implementation: `components/table-of-contents.tsx` (client) + `headings` prop on `SeoPageLayout`.

- **Desktop:** sticky “On this page” beside the article.
- **Mobile:** collapsible “Contents” at the top of the article column.
- **Active state:** `IntersectionObserver` to highlight the section in view.

All published SEO routes that use `SeoPageLayout` (pillars, guides, compare, glossary, and programmatic `/watch/...-with-friends` pages) pass `headings` with matching `id` / `scroll-mt-24` on section headings so the TOC stays in sync.

---

## 100-page build order (summary)

| Priority | Template | Count | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Template A (top anime) | 50 | Highest volume, direct product fit |
| 2 | Template C (how-tos) | 20 | Snippets + intent |
| 3 | Template D (listicles) | 15 | Funnel to Template A |
| 4 | Template B (comparisons) | 10 | Competitor + conversion |
| 5 | Template A (seasonal / airing) | 5 | Topicality |

Use the seed list and topic lists in this doc’s Template sections as the working backlog.
