    question: "What is asynchronous anime watching?",

    question: "Does Crunchyroll have a built-in watch party feature?",

        <strong>
          You can watch Crunchyroll together with friends using AniDachi —
          a Chrome extension that syncs playback, creates watchrooms, and adds
          real-time chat on top of your existing Crunchyroll account.
        </strong>{" "}
        Unlike Discord screen sharing, everyone watches in full quality on their
        own account. Unlike Teleparty, you can watch asynchronously — no
        scheduling required.

        Why Crunchyroll Doesn&apos;t Have a Watch Party Feature
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        As of 2026, Crunchyroll still has no built-in watch-together or
        watch-party feature — unlike Amazon Prime Video or Hulu. This means
        anime fans must rely on third-party tools to create shared viewing
        sessions. The most popular options are Chrome extensions like AniDachi
        and Crunchyroll Party, or screen sharing via Discord.

        What Makes AniDachi Different
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        AniDachi is the only Crunchyroll watch-party tool designed for
        <strong> asynchronous watching</strong>. Friends don&apos;t need to be
        online at the same time. Each person watches at their own pace, marks
        episodes, and leaves time-stamped reactions. This solves the biggest
        problem with live watch parties: scheduling across time zones and busy
        lives.
