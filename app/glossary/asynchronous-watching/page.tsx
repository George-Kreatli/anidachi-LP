    answer:
      "Asynchronous watching means each person in a group watches anime episodes on their own schedule, not at the same time. They share progress, reactions, and comments through a persistent watchroom that everyone can access whenever they watch.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which apps support asynchronous anime watching?",
    answer:
      "AniDachi is currently the only anime watch-party tool that fully supports asynchronous watching with per-user progress tracking and persistent chat. Other tools like Teleparty and Crunchyroll Party only support live synchronized watching.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is async watching better than live watching?",
    answer:
      "Neither is universally better. Async works well for groups with different schedules or time zones. Live watching is better for premieres and finales where simultaneous reactions are the point. AniDachi supports both in the same watchroom.",

        What Is Asynchronous Anime Watching?
      </h1>

        <strong>
          Asynchronous anime watching means friends watch the same anime at
          their own pace — not at the same time — and share reactions, comments,
          and progress through a shared watchroom.
        </strong>{" "}
        It&apos;s like a book club for anime: everyone reads at their own speed,
        then discusses.

        <li>Someone creates a watchroom for a specific anime.</li>
        <li>Everyone joins via invite link.</li>
        <li>Each person watches episodes whenever they have time.</li>

        Why Async Is Growing
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Coordinating schedules across time zones is the number-one pain point
        for anime watch groups. Async watching removes that friction entirely.
        It&apos;s especially popular for long-running series (One Piece, Naruto)
        where different people are at different points.
