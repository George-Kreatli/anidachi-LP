    answer:
      "An asynchronous watch party lets each person watch episodes on their own schedule. You share a watchroom, mark episodes as watched, leave reactions and comments, and friends see them when they catch up. No scheduling required.",

    question: "Which tools support asynchronous anime watching?",
    answer:
      "AniDachi is currently the only Crunchyroll watch-party tool that supports fully asynchronous watching with progress tracking and persistent chat. Teleparty, Crunchyroll Party, and Discord only support live sync.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is live or async better for anime?",
    answer:
      "Live is great for premieres and season finales when everyone wants to react simultaneously. Async is better for ongoing series where people have different schedules, especially across time zones.",

        Asynchronous vs Live Anime Watch Parties: Which Is Right for You?
      </h1>

      <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        <strong>
          Asynchronous watching lets friends watch at their own pace and share
          reactions later. Live watch parties require everyone online at the
          same time.
        </strong>{" "}
        Both have pros and cons. Here&apos;s how to pick the right approach
        for your anime group.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
        What Is a Live Watch Party?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        A live watch party means everyone starts watching at the same time with
        synchronized playback. You pause, play, and seek together. Chat happens
        in real-time. This is how most tools (Teleparty, Crunchyroll Party,
        Discord) work. The downside: scheduling is hard, especially across time
        zones.
      </p>

        What Is Asynchronous Watching?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Asynchronous (async) watching means each person watches on their own
        schedule. A shared watchroom tracks everyone&apos;s progress. You leave
        reactions, comments, and ratings on each episode, and friends see them
        when they catch up. Think of it like a book club for anime — everyone
        reads at their own pace, then discusses.
