          How to Create an Anime Watch Party
        </h1>

        <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          <strong>
            Creating an anime watch party is possible by gathering everyone on
            the same episode with a shared chat layer. The easiest way is AniDachi
            because it auto-detects the series on Crunchyroll, spins up a
            watchroom, and hands you a single invite link new guests can follow in
            minutes.

          Method 1: AniDachi (Crunchyroll-native hosting)
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Hosting should feel like starting a group text, not configuring a
          server. AniDachi focuses on the repetitive chores: recognizing which
          anime is playing, attaching chat to that context, and giving moderators
          a predictable invite flow. You still communicate house rules—no
          unmuted mics crunching chips—but the technical scaffolding stays short.

          Method 2: Discord (scheduled stage or voice)
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Create a Discord event, pick a voice channel, and decide whether you
          will screen share or ask everyone to press play manually. Discord shines
          for banter; it is lighter on automated Crunchyroll sync unless you pair
          it with another tool.

          Method 3: Calendar invite + honor-system sync
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Low-tech clubs sometimes email a calendar invite and trust everyone to
          press play at :00. That can survive for movies, yet anime episodes invite
          mid-credit scenes and post-credit stingers that desync casual countdowns.
